# Link Lurker Discord Bot

Link Lurker is a Discord bot designed to monitor messages in a server, identify specific URLs, and modify them according to predefined rules.

Testing

## Features

- Monitors all messages in every channel for URLs.
- Modifies URLs containing `instagram.com` and `tiktok.com`:
  - Adds `dd` to the front of Instagram links (e.g., `www.instagram.com/whatever` becomes `www.ddinstagram.com/whatever`).
  - Replaces `tiktok` with `tnk` in TikTok links (e.g., `www.tiktok.com/whatever` becomes `www.tnktok.com/whatever`).
